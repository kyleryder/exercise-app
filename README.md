# exercise-app

This is just a simple exercise app I made to store different weight lifting exercises and the muscle groups they work.
The idea is to breakdown exercises based on muscle group and other factors in order to make it easier for me to program myself and others.
Ideally, each exercise added will be among my favorites to select if I am looking to train a specific group, but users will be able to add 
their own files and custom exercises if they have options that are not included.
